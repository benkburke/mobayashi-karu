## Requirements

### Summary

Fork this git repo and create a web application using a "stack" of your choice. Think [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), bonus points for using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Spec

The web application should be a simple "todo" style app and has the following requirements:

Users must be able to:

* add items to the to-do list
* edit items in the to-do list
* mark items as complete
* search for specific items using a search bar
* all changes should be persistent

### extra credit

Add a richer feacher set with something you would want out of a todo app.

For example

* Wire up an actual API to call which does the persistence
* Add meta data to the to-do, such as categories and filter on the meta data 
* Add user access controls ( user / groups / roles )
* _insert your idea here_

## Done

When done with the assignment, please open a [pull request](https://github.com/greencheckverified/mobayashi-karu/compare) with your solution.
